     	<h3>What to expect at auditions</h3>

 		<h5>Range Test:</h5>
 		<p>We will test your range with a keyboard exercise.</p>

 		<h5>Chord Matching: </h5>
 		<p>
 			We will play chords (three tones) and you will sing the pitches that you hear.  We will demonstrate this in your audition, don't worry if this isn't your forte.
 		</p>
 		<h5>Solo: </h5>
 		<p>
 			Prepare a verse and a chorus (1-2 minutes) of a song that you can sing without accompaniment.  Your choice should be something that best represents and showcases your voice.
